# zim-sa

‡•ê
As all people of our civilisation intentionally started betraying our civilisation's wisdom and culture, And started thinking working for some
multinational companies, and enjoying material pleasures is only greatness in life. This is actually what British wanted, derooting us from our own
culture wisdom, with infected education system they planted , which is working very well in producing money slaves in the name of developement.
So it is our duty to make our civilisation know their greatness, which they kept suppressed intentionally.

Jai sriram..

To make our texts accessible to all 'Developed!' people, only way is made it avialble in electronic format , which they have access, more than books.
But unfortunately Internet is not avialble cheaply. so it will be useful if we can provide the content ofline, And making option avialble to serve content 
to an entire institution premices, with out much server equipment and internet.

Here comes zim and kiwix handful to fullfill that job. presently kiwix can do

1. Kiwix can read zim files, which are nothing but all website compressed to one single file.
   And keeping javascripts, and formatting, images all safe.

2. And we can save any page back to html from zim file, and can dump back zim files to html files.

3. And very main feature is we can set up server with kiwix!!! which is very important feature

   If we have zim file, and install kiwix-serve , then it acts like server, and any one can access content via wifi
   in premices, with out having internet at them or at server. So it will be too useful in schools, collages,Institutions, universities
   Rural areas, where internet is inaccessable. And we can even serve content without much equipment too, 
   Just a raspberry pie even can act as kiwix-server 

4. To start kiwix server, jut launch kiwix, click on tools, and select server, then server menu appears, start from there.
   for complete referance this url will be very helpfull http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-serve

kiwix has all platform clients. so mobile devices also can access off line content.And pcs can both read and serve to premices too.


So i will try to make all important books and websites avialable in this format, and will update once a two months as sites
 keep on adding new content. presently avialable files are listed here.

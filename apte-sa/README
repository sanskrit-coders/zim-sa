As kiwix-serve can be used as server, it will be helpful if there are dictionaries too.
It is nothing but providing html formatting and interface to dictionary file.
So we can browse on kiwix, or browser using kiwix-serve as server.

dictionary is page structured. every page contains some 20 words. and links to next and previous
pages were given. And most importantly, it is word searchable, if you search for aa word,
then it takes you to the position of that word in page that contains it. So we can search or browse.

To start kiwix-serve go to kiwix >> tools >> server. and start server there, and open in browser.
And formatting is completely mobile friendly. so you can use it on android/ios easefully.

please give suggestions to improve browsing experience, or html layout if you want to chaange.

Thanks

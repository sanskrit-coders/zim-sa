जय श्रीराम 
Here is  zim file of valmiki ramayana. content is from valmikiramayan.net , with minimal  changes.
all kandas, andd sargas, shlokas are connected well, so  you can browse easily. and shloka pointer is there in every sarga.

And good thing is you can use search bar to search sargas quickly.
like if you enter '1.15' (with out single quotes) , then it will take you to 15th sarga of 1st kanda (baala kaanda).
So you can browse by clicking links,, or directly use search bar.

Soon i will add feature to search a shloka from entire book... then it wiill be too useful.
plz provide ur suggestions to  improve it.It is very allpha version. So many changes for good can be done in future updates.

thanks..
